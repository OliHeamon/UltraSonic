UltraSonic is designed to be the last music mod you'll ever need in terraria.

Featuring a beautiful and easy to use GUI that can be toggled with a keybind, the user can input a YouTube link to download its audio into the ingame library. From there, the user can play these songs ingame.

It goes further than this though: the song can then be assigned to replace any boss theme, biome theme, or even play just before or after the user's death. This results in endless customisation that can replace any other music mod in existence.

Update Log:

v1.3.4:
-Fixed file permissions issue on linux that caused FFmpeg to not run properly.

v1.3:
- [!!!] Fixed a bug where text would fail to render properly on UI scales above or below 100%.

-The mod now includes FFmpeg versions for Mac OSX and Linux, meaning the mod now should work on all platforms.
